<div class="text">dear friend,
<br>
<br>the one in 51. you are a one-of-a-kind. hope this finds you well. hope you find what you were looking for. wherever you were before, well, here you are, so welcome! perhaps you're also looking for that "treasure hidden in a field" or somewhere else if you will. wherever you go, hope you'll be filled, always instilled with peace, love & joy so deep within and far without, so powerful, so pure, so true in keeping you atlas ...so free, always ready to be... on your earthly soul..joy..rney.
<br>
<br>what you'll find here: some artwork, some poems, some merch, some techie stuff, some salt, spice, some sprinkling of bible verses more than thrice, my diary of esoteric explorations, oh yeah, and my many moon mi$$ions & side quests for the mooney in this moonopo-lies, for which without, we may instead be spreading all the wealth. idealy. but for the sake of practicality, and because not many of us has the skills to actually be truely wild/free, then the humster wheel will have to do. keeping in mind though, the only wealth worthy of hodling may be the "kingdom of God", like unto the "treasure hid in a field", and yet Jesus also said, "the kingdom of God is within you..."! feel free to enlighten me.
<br>
<br>while there are tons of info out there.. here however, all worldly matters will be taken with a grain of salt, though admittedly, some topics may require deep esoteric explorations, which apparently seemed hidden ..yet all in plain sight! once you know, you just knew it, right? as always, let's keep calm and remain free & far from the collective hive mind, far enough to observe so not to be part of the whole experiment. as truth lovers alike, let's remind ourselves to stay kind, courageous, and ...dry (with some humor) amidst the roaring & raging sea of information, seeking to swallow as many people alive and whole (like fish) in-(to)-formation.
<br>
<br>all right friend, hope you will find that well of the living and living well until the end, which is when it all began again. much love!
<br><br>p.s. there is another wise saying that "the love of money is the root of all evil" and so, “for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” (mt 13:44)
